## Assignment 2 March 3, 2023
# PART - I: Data Structures
For the first part, you will write several classes to implement different data structures.

# PART - II: Information Parsing with Stacks 
In PART-II, you will decode and parse strings that contain compressed information.

# PART - III: Caterpillar Game
In PART-III, you will write a small caterpillar game. The figure below shows a 2D map with a caterpillar (blue) and food (red). 
The caterpillar can move around in this 2D map. Whenever the caterpillar’s head reaches the food, it can “eat” the food and grow one cell bigger. 
You will write a small program that moves the caterpillar, and the final goal is to eat everything on the map.
